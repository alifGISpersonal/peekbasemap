# peekbasemap
An interactive ArcGIS JavaScript demo that lets users “peek” at satellite imagery through a movable circular lens on top of a vector basemap. The lens follows the cursor, supports adjustable buffer distance in kilometers, synchronizes view scale/rotation, and displays real-time coordinates and buffer geometry.
